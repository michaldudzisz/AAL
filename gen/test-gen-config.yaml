aLowercaseProbability: 0.99      # double - probability, that extra character in "a" string will be lowercase
bLowercaseProbability: 0.01      # double - probability, that single character in "b" string is going to be lowercase
bToLowerProbability: 0.6         # double - pobability, that single character of "b" will be converted to lowercase creating "a" string
